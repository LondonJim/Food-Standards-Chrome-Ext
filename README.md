# Food Standard Checker

A chrome extension to be used in conjunction with major food delivery services websites in the UK. When complete it will display the current food hygiene rating recorded by the Food Standards Agency for the current on page restaurant/cafe/takeaway the user is thinking of getting a delivery from. Currently at least two of the major UK food delivery services don't list this hygiene information and in some cases even the restaurant can not be found on the Food Standard Agency list.

So this extension aims to fix this and provide the user with easy to obtain information so they can make an informed choice when ordering food.

Yeah!
